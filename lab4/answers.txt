# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We implemented a forking system to make the downloads and uploads in parallel.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

There was a strcpy command which would have caused the buffer overrun problem in
the function "start_download". We changed it to a strncpy, where we limited the
size of the file that could be copied to FILENAMESIZ. This will prevent the
buffer overrun bug. 
Added a check to make sure that if we repeatedly receive requests from the same peer
we continue to allow for other peers to make requests as well.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

1. Checked for the working directory
2. Increased TASKBUFSIZE to prevent too many peers bug
3. Imposed a limit of 100MiB to prevent unlimited data downloading

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: Implemented MD5 Check for file integrity.

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
