Added deadlock test cases to a new file, test.pl

Implemented deadlock checking using a queue mechanism which traces through
all potentially conflicting processes to make sure they aren't waiting on
something the current process has. Created a process queue for every disk
and checked the queues every time a lock request arrived to scan for conflicts.


Limitations:
In test.pl, some of the test cases (6 and 7) fail sometimes because a random space gets
added after the output, and other times it is ommitted. It is not consistent
at all and is related to the read call.
